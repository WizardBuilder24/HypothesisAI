## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Project Overview
HypothesisAI is a domain-agnostic, multi-agent scientific research acceleration platform built on LangGraph that automates literature review, synthesis, and hypothesis generation for academic researchers. The platform addresses the critical pain point that researchers spend 60% of their time on literature review rather than creative hypothesis generation.

### 1.2 Business Objectives
- **Primary Goal:** Reduce research hypothesis generation time by 40-60%
- **Market Capture:** Achieve 5,000 active users within 12 months
- **Revenue Target:** $500K ARR by end of Year 1, $5M ARR by Year 3
- **Academic Impact:** 100+ papers citing HypothesisAI by Year 2

### 1.3 Key Deliverables
- Open-source multi-agent research platform
- Integration with 9+ academic databases
- Freemium SaaS platform for individual researchers
- Enterprise features for research institutions
- Comprehensive documentation and API

### 1.4 Success Criteria
- 5% free-to-paid conversion rate
- 90% annual retention for paid customers
- <2 second response time for standard queries
- 99.9% uptime for production services
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
