## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Project Title
HypothesisAI - Multi-Agent Scientific Research Acceleration Platform

### 1.2 Project Description
HypothesisAI is a comprehensive, domain-agnostic research acceleration platform that leverages LangGraph's multi-agent orchestration capabilities to transform how academic researchers conduct literature reviews, synthesize knowledge, and generate hypotheses. The platform will integrate with major open-source academic databases to provide researchers with an intelligent assistant ecosystem that reduces research time by 40-60% while maintaining scientific rigor and accuracy.

### 1.3 Project Justification
Academic researchers currently spend approximately 60% of their time on literature review and synthesis, leaving limited time for creative hypothesis generation and experimental design. Existing tools provide fragmented solutions - reference managers handle citations, search engines find papers, and AI tools offer basic summarization - but no platform provides integrated, intelligent research acceleration. HypothesisAI addresses this gap by creating a unified platform that automates the entire research workflow while maintaining the scientific rigor required for academic work.

### 1.4 Project Objectives
- **Primary Objective:** Reduce time from research question to validated hypothesis by 40-60%
- **Secondary Objectives:**
  - Democratize access to AI-powered research tools for individual researchers
  - Improve research quality through multi-source verification and bias detection
  - Foster interdisciplinary research through cross-domain knowledge synthesis
  - Build a sustainable open-source ecosystem for research tool development
